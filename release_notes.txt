    * Support for 21.05 Ethos-U component (core-software, core-driver, Vela 3.0.0).
    * TensorFlow submodule changed to https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro (tested with TensorFlow Lite Micro commit hash: f510d38d0eaa3195ce3af66e3f32648740f08afb).
    * Image classification model changed (from uint8 to int8 datatype).
    * Documentation updates, added support to Corstone-300 + Ethos-U65.
    * Various scripts improvements.
